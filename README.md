## Description

Welcome to the website dedicated to Polish lakes! I have implemented a few web development techniques to ensure the best user experience possible. First and foremost, I focused on simplicity and clarity, making it easy for you to find the information you're interested in. My website is also fully responsive, meaning it adapts to various screen sizes, allowing for comfortable use on computers, tablets, and smartphones.
